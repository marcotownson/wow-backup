# Wow! Signal Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the "Wow!" signal, a strong narrowband radio signal detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977. The project is led by Marco Townson and utilizes a variety of techniques to decrypt and analyze the signal.

## Project Structure

-   `archive/`: Contains the different phases of the analysis.
    -   `phase1/`: The initial analysis and exploration of the signal.
    -   `phase2/`: The current, consolidated analysis pipeline.
-   `react-app/`: A React-based website for documenting the project's progress and findings.
-   `ABOUT.md`: Detailed information about the Wow! signal and this project.

## How to Run

The main analysis script is located in `archive/phase2/consolidated_analyzer.py`. To run it, you will need to have the required Python packages installed. You can find a list of these in `archive/phase1/requirements.txt`.
