      <h2>Semantic Analyzer (with Chinese Language Support)</h2>
      <p>
        This script represents a significant expansion of our analysis, adopting a "kitchen
        sink" approach to decoding the Wow! signal. It moves beyond the simple blueprint
        theory to explore a much wider range of possibilities, including the idea that the
        message might be encoded in a human language.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Analysis Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-Width and Encoding Sweeps:</strong> The script systematically tests
          various fixed-width encodings (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 bits) and alternative base
          encodings (Base36, Base64).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ASCII and Symbolic Analysis:</strong> It attempts to decode the signal as
          ASCII and also searches for symbolic mathematical relationships (e.g., a = b*c)
          between the decoded numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prime Number and Ratio Detection:</strong> The script actively searches
          for prime numbers and for ratios that approximate fundamental constants (Pi, e,
          etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chinese Language Analysis:</strong> In a bold move, the script tries to
          decode the binary string using various Chinese character encodings (UTF-8, GBK,
          Big5) and then searches for scientific keywords in Chinese.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A Shift in Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>
        The inclusion of Chinese language analysis marks a major shift in the
        investigation. It suggests that the researchers are now considering the
        possibility that the signal is not just a technical blueprint, but a rich,
        multi-layered message intended for a technologically advanced civilization—one
        that might even share linguistic roots with one of humanity's oldest languages.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        This "master validator" is a dragnet designed to catch any conceivable pattern in
        the signal. While it's unlikely that all of these analyses will yield positive
        results, any significant finding—be it a symbolic equation, a cluster of prime
        numbers, or a Chinese keyword—would be a groundbreaking discovery. This script
        represents the most exhaustive and open-minded analysis of the Wow! signal to
        date.
