      <h2>Wow! Signal Semantic Analyzer</h2>
      <p>
        This script is a comprehensive, "kitchen sink" analysis tool designed to leave
        no stone unturned in our quest to decode the Wow! signal. It represents a broad,
        exploratory phase of the investigation, moving beyond any single hypothesis to test
        a wide array of potential encoding schemes and semantic content.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Analysis Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-Width and Encoding Sweeps:</strong> The script systematically tests
          various fixed-width encodings (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 bits) and alternative base
          encodings (Base36, Base64), searching for the optimal way to parse the binary
          string.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ASCII and Symbolic Analysis:</strong> It attempts to decode the signal as
          7-bit and 8-bit ASCII and also searches for symbolic mathematical relationships
          (e.g., a = b*c) between the decoded numbers. This could reveal encoded
          mathematical formulas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prime Number and Ratio Detection:</strong> The script actively searches
          for prime numbers and for ratios that approximate fundamental mathematical
          constants (Pi, e, etc.), which would be strong signs of intelligence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>An Exhaustive Search for Meaning</h3>
      <p>
        This "master validator" is a dragnet designed to catch any conceivable pattern in
        the signal. It represents a shift from a single-minded focus on the "blueprint"
        theory to a more open-minded exploration of the signal's potential meaning.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        While it's unlikely that all of these analyses will yield positive results, any
        significant finding—be it a symbolic equation, a cluster of prime numbers, or a
        meaningful ASCII message—would be a groundbreaking discovery. This script
        represents the most exhaustive and unbiased analysis of the Wow! signal to date,
        and its results will be crucial in guiding the next phase of our research.
