# About the Wow! Signal Analysis Project

## The Wow! Signal

The "Wow!" signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977, while working on a SETI project at the Big Ear radio telescope of Ohio State University. The signal was unexpected and bore the expected hallmarks of a non-terrestrial and non-Solar System origin. It lasted for the full 72-second window that Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since.

The signal's name comes from Ehman's annotation on the computer printout: "Wow!".

## The Project

This project, created by Marco Townson, is a deep dive into the "Wow!" signal, specifically the alphanumeric sequence "6EQUJ5" that represents its intensity variation. The project aims to explore various hypotheses about the signal's nature and origin through a comprehensive analysis pipeline.

### Project Creator

-   **Name:** Marco Townson
-   **Location:** Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, HD5
-   **Age:** 36
-   **Interests:** Astrology, astrophysics, physics, quantum entanglement, mathematics, and the search for something more.

## Methodology

The project employs a multi-faceted approach to analyzing the signal, including:

-   **Self-Referential Decryption:** A novel decryption method that uses the signal's own properties to derive a binary string for analysis.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** Examination of the binary data's statistical properties, such as Shannon entropy and n-gram frequencies.
-   **Geometric Visualization:** Representing the binary data in various geometric forms, such as bitmaps and spherical maps, to search for visual patterns.
-   **Quantum Evolution Modeling:** Treating the binary string as a quantum state and evolving it over time to reveal complex dynamics.
-   **Physics Modeling:** Analyzing the physical properties of the evolving quantum system to determine its nature.
-   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide a synopsis of the findings and suggest next steps.

This project is an ongoing exploration into one of the most intriguing mysteries in modern science.
